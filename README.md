Howdy, I'm Myles Denardo! I'm making the jump to become a full-stack web developer. I've spent the better part of a decade in microbiology and beer brewing and look forward to bringing my knack for process, team management and problem solving to the tech realm! Well practiced in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, I am currently honing my skills in OOP, Geolocation APIs and asynchronous js. In my free time I'm either on my skateboard or bike cruising around Brooklyn!
